### 1.3 Flashing and Boot Settings

OK527 supports TF card and USB OTG programming, and the hardware supports eMMC startup.

Insert the TF card into the development board before powering on. After powering on, the TF card flashing process will begin; otherwise, it will boot from eMMC. For detailed flashing instructions, please refer to the "System Flashing".

**Note: The OK527 development board does not support SPI NOR booting.**

## 2. Fast Startup

### 2.1 Preparation Before Startup

The OK527 development board has two system login methods, serial and network login. 

Hardware preparation before system startup:

- 12V3A DC Power Cable;

  Debugging serial cable (Serial Login);

- The development board features a USB Type-C port for debugging purposes, allowing you to connect it to a PC using a Type-A to Type-C cable in order to access the board's status information;

- Network cable (for network login);

- According to the development board interface to connect the screen (Based on display needs);

- Check the booting method (the system will prioritize booting from the TF card if inserted; otherwise, it will boot from eMMC).

### 2.2 Serial Port Login

#### 2.2.1 Serial Login

**Description:**

- **Serial port settings: Baud rate 115200, data bit 8, stop bit 1, no parity bit, no flow control;**
- **The serial terminal login uses the root user without password;**
- **Software requirements: PC Windows system needs to install the terminal software. Because the terminal software has many types, users can choose their familiar one.**

The following is an example of how to set up the terminal using putty (02-User Information \\01-Software Information \\04-Tools\\putty-64-bit\_x86.exe):

Step 1: Connect the development board and the PC using a serial cable, and verify the serial port number recognized by the computer through the “Device Manager”. 

The port number recognized by the computer should be considered as the accurate one; 

Choose “USB-Enhanced-SERIAL-A CH342”.

![Image](./images/OK527N-C_Linux5.15.47_User_Manual/9e2cca0969df41fe9a59ca302f92aae7.png)

Step 2: Open and configure PuTTY; set the serial line to match the COM port of your computer with a baud rate of 115200.

![Image](./images/OK527N-C_Linux5.15.47_User_Manual/cf849bee2bee42779e11bcba90fd3e14.png)

Step 3: Power on the development board. Serial port will output printing information until “root@OK527:/#” appears, indicating the completion of the boot process. The system defaults to the root account with no password required for login.

#### 2.2.2 Serial Login Common Problems

Connect the PC side to the development board through the Type-C adapter cable and install the corresponding driver (User Information-Software Information\\3-Tools\\CH343SER.ZIP).

It is better to use a good quality cable to avoid error codes.

### 2.3 Network Login Methods

#### 2.3.1 Network Connection Test

**Description:**

- **The default factory IP for eth0 is 192.168.0.232;**
- **The computer and board should be on the same network segment for testing.**

Before login, you should ensure the network connection between the computer and the development board is normal, and use the ping command to test the connection status. 

The specific method of operation is as follows:

1\. Connect eth0 of the development board to the computer through the network and power up the development board. A red light on the SoM will blink after the kernel starts, and the network card connected to the computer will blink quickly after normal startup. At this point, we can test the network connection;

![Image](./images/OK527N-C_Linux5.15.47_User_Manual/2c6fb190a0024aaaa36d36d1f6d5864e.png)

2\. Close the computer firewall (General computer operations, not described here in detail), then open the computer's run command;

### 2.4 Screen Switching

Currently, screen switching supports two methods: U-Boot menu and QT application.

In addition, the following rules shall be followed for screen configuration:

```plain
 When outputting on a single screen, the other disp _ type must be none and the disp _ pri _ type must be the same as the output
```

```plain
 When LCD and DP are selected to output simultaneously, LCD must be selected as the main screen
```

a)    LCD includes “lcd 1024x600”“mipi 1024x600”“lvds 1280x800”;

b)	DP includes “dp 1080P60”“dp 2.5k”;

c)    HDMI automatically configures resolution based on edid.

#### 2.4.1 Dynamic Control of Uboot Menu

This method allows switching without recompiling and burn-in of existing supported screens.

During the Uboot boot process, pressing the spacebar will enter the uboot menu.

```plain
---------------------------------------------
0:Exit to console
1:Reboot
2:Display0 Type:lvds 1280x800
3:Display1 Type:hdmi
4:Device PHY Type:none
5:display primary screen: disp0_type
---------------------------------------------
```

The menu options are as follows:

Enter 0 to enter the uboot command line;

Enter 1 to restart uboot;

Enter 2 will cyclically select the Display0 Type screen;

Enter 3 will cyclically select the Display1 Type screen;

Enter 4 will cyclically select the multiplexing of PCIe and USB3.0.

Enter 5 will cyclically select the main screen;

Take the "LVDS 1280x800" and "HDMI" screens as an example. After entering the uboot menu, press the corresponding number until the following content is displayed, and then press 1 to restart.

```plain
---------------------------------------------
0:Exit to console
1:Reboot
2:Display0 Type:lvds 1280x800
3:Display1 Type:hdmi
4:Device PHY Type:none
5:display primary screen: disp0_type
---------------------------------------------
```

**Note: The current version does not support DP 2560x1440 resolution and HDMI 3840 × 2160 resolution**

    	**The DP screen cannot be displayed alone**

#### 2.4.2 Qt Program Screen Switching

This method allows switching without recompiling and burn-in of existing supported screens.

Refer to 3.19 Switching Screen Display.

### 2.5 System Storage

OK527 has multiple specifications, the following are 2+16GB versions.

Mem:           1934         258        1455          13         221        1638
Swap:             0           0           0
```

### 2.6 System Shutdown

In general, the power can be turned off directly. If there is data storage, function use, or other operations, avoid turning off the power arbitrarily during operation to prevent irreversible damage to the file. In such cases, only re-flashing the firmware can resolve the issue. Before powering off, use the sync command to ensure data is fully written.

The command ‘‘reboot’‘ can be used to restart the development board. You can also restart the hardware by pressing the K3 (RESET) key or directly power off and restart.

Long-pressing the K2 (PWRON) button on the development board can turn off the device, and long-pressing K2 again can turn it on.

**Note：If the user-designed product using the SoM experiences an unexpected shutdown due to power loss during operation, power-down protection measures can be included in the design to prevent this issue.**

## 3\. OK527 Platform Interface Function Use and Test

<font style="color:black;"> </font>**Description:**

**Users should follow this section when using the screen with the QT file system, but can skip it for non-QT operations.**

**This chapter details QT functions. With the default device and driver working normally, it's advisable to test interface functions after command line tests.**

QT test source code path: source code OK 527-linux-sdk/platform/forlinx/forlinx \_ qt \_ demo.

Testing program path in the development board’s file system: /usr/bin.

To activate the watchdog, set the reset time to 10 seconds, and regularly "feed" the watchdog, you can use thefltest\_watchdogcommand. This command will open the watchdog and perform the necessary "feeding" operation, ensuring that the system does not reboot.

```plain
root@OK527:/#fltest_watchdog -t 10 -c
Watchdog Ticking Away!
```

When using ctrl+c to end the test program, kicking the dog is stopped, the watchdog is on, and the system is reset after 10s.

If you do not want to reset, please enter the command to close the watchdog within 10 seconds after ending the program:

```plain
root@OK527:/# fltest_watchdog -d                                          //Turn off the watchdog
```

Start watchdog, set reset time 10s, do not kick the watchdog.

This command turns on the watchdog, but does not feed the dog, and the system restarts after 10 seconds.

```plain
root@OK527:/# fltest_watchdog -t 10
```

### 4.6 RTC Function Test

**Note: Ensure button cell batteries are installed \& voltage is normal.**

<font style="color:black;">RTC </font><font style="color:black;">test, mainly through the use of </font><font style="color:black;"> date </font><font style="color:black;"> and </font><font style="color:black;"> hwclock </font><font style="color:black;"> tools to set the software and hardware time, test whether the software clock reads the </font><font style="color:black;"> RTC </font><font style="color:black;">clock synchronously when the board is powered off and then powered on.</font>

```plain
root@OK527:/#date -s "2023-08-01 15:16:30"                              //Set software time
Tue Aug  1 15:16:30 CST 2023
root@OK527:/# hwclock -u -w                                    //Synchronize software time to hardware time
root@OK527:/# hwclock -u -r                                                //Display hardware time
Tue Aug  1 15:16:40 2023  0.000000 seconds
```

<font style="color:black;">Then power down and power up the board, enter the system, and read the system time. After that, we can see that the time has synchronized.</font>

### 4.16 Ethernet Configuration

OK527-C comes with 2 x Gigabit Ethernet ports. When connected to the network via an Ethernet cable, the factory default configuration sets eth0 to the static IP 192.168.0.232. The OK527-C's network card can be configured via the configuration file /etc/network/interfaces.

#### 4.16.1 Gigabit Ethernet Static IP Configuration

**Note: In the kernel, the Gigabit Ethernet card is identified as eth0, and its default IP address is 192.168.0.232.**

After booting the development board, execute the following command to open the network configuration file/etc/network/interfaces

```plain
root@OK527:/#vi /etc/network/interfaces
```

Content as follows (slight differences may occur after software version updates; users should refer to actual information):

iface：Used to specify a network card that requires a fixed IP;

address: Used to specify an IP address that needs to be fixed;

netmask: Used to set the subnet mask;

gateway: Used to specify a gateway;

```plain
root@OK527:/# cat /etc/network/interfaces
# interface file auto-generated by buildroot

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.0.232
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.0.1
root@OK527:/#
```

<font style="color:black;">Set</font><font style="color:black;">nameserver</font>

```plain
root@OK527:/#vi /etc/resolve.conf

nameserver  114.114.114.114
nameserver  8.8.8.8
```

After setting according to the actual situation, save and exit, use sync to synchronize, restart the development board or execute the ip addr flush dev eth0 to clear the network card ip, and then use the ifdown-a and ifup-a commands to restart and stop the configuration, so that the configuration file can take effect.

#### 4.16.2 Ethernet Speed Test

**Description:**

**Test the communication speed between the development board and the computer to ensure that they can communicate properly.**

**The iperf3 tool (02-User Data\\01-Software Data\\04-Tools\\iperf-3.1.3-win64.zip) is assumed to be installed on Windows for this test.**

The OK527-C SoM has a controllable red LED that flashes when the card is powered on.

The testing method is as follows:

1\. To view trigger conditions:

```plain
root@OK527:/# cat /sys/class/leds/heartbeat/trigger
none rc-feedback rfkill-any rfkill-none kbd-scrolllock kbd-numlock kbd-capslock kbd-kanalock kbd-shiftlock kbd-altgrlock kbd-ctrllock kbd-altlock kbd-shiftllock kbd-shiftrlock kbd-ctrlllock kbd-ctrlrlock mmc0 mmc1 [heartbeat] rfkill0
```

Where \[heartbeat] indicates that the current trigger condition is the system heartbeat light. Write the above string in trigger to modify the trigger condition.

2\. User Control

When the led trigger condition is set to none, the user can control the on and off of the led lamp through the command:

```plain
root@OK527:/# echo none > /sys/class/leds/heartbeat/trigger
root@OK527:/# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/heartbeat/brightness
root@OK527:/# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/heartbeat/brightness
```

3\. Change the red LED to a heartbeat light

```plain
root@OK527:/# echo heartbeat > /sys/class/leds/heartbeat/trigger
```

At this time, the LED has a system clock control, blinking according to a certain rhythm.

### 4.26 A55 CoreMark Test

The most well-known and commonly used Benchmarks in the field of embedded processors are Dhrystone and CoreMark. CoreMark is a comprehensive benchmark that is used to measure the performance of the central processing unit (CPU) employed in embedded systems. It was developed by shay gal-on of eembc in 2009, aiming to become an industry standard and replace the outdated dehrystone benchmark.

The OK527-C platform has the CoreMark test program ported by default, and you can use the following commands to test it:

1\. Set the CPU small core and large core to high-performance mode respectively.

```plain
root@OK527:/# echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
root@OK527:/# echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu4/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

### 4.37 NPU Test

OK527N-C integrates 2Tops NPU and currently has six models built-in: Fairmot, MobileNet\_V2, VGG19, struct 2depth, yolact, and yolov5s-sim-640.

This section mainly demonstrates the use of NPU through routines.

The location of the NPU test routine is as follows:

```plain
root@OK527:/# ls /etc/npu/sample_viplite
Fairmot  MobileNet_V2  VGG19  struct2depth  yolact  yolov5s-sim-640

root@OK527:/# ls /etc/npu/sample_viplite/Fairmot/
1088x608x3.dat  network_binary.nb  sample.txt


//  1088x608x3.dat   Input data for test
//  network_binary.nb Network model for testing
//  sample.txt        Configuration file for test
```

The configuration file is as follows:

```plain
root@OK527:/# cd /etc/npu/sample_viplite/Fairmot
root@OK527:/etc/npu/sample_viplite/Fairmot# cat sample.txt

vpm_run is a framework for testing VIPLite driver.

#You may put comment by starting with a '#'.
#####################################################A separator makes the list clear.
[network]
/etc/npu/sample_viplite/Fairmot/network_binary.nb      //Specify the network model to use
[input]
/etc/npu/sample_viplite/Fairmot/1088x608x3.dat        //Specify the input data                 

You can also add comparison files and output files by adding [golden] and [output] in the configuration file:
[network]
./ network_binary.nb
[input]
./ input_0.dat
[ golden]                                   //Compare files
./ output0_10_1.dat
[output]                                     //Output files
./ output_0.dat             
Here's how to run it: -l 10 means execute the test 10 times, and the results are as follows
root@OK527:/etc/npu/sample_viplite/Fairmot# vpm_run -s sample.txt -l 10

#### 6.2.3 OTG Flashing Common Issues

1\. Driver installation failed

Some users still see an "Unknown Device" after installing USB drivers per the manual. Clicking on it shows a message about a third-party INF lacking digital signature info, as shown below.

![Image](./images/OK527N-C_Linux5.15.47_User_Manual/add5cacc0f3944ca9e281a9e532154e2.png)

This occurs because some Windows systems disallow unsigned drivers to ensure system stability, resulting in failed installation of unsigned drivers. Users need to disable driver signature enforcement on their computers before installing drivers according to the manual.

- Solution to the problem that the third-party INF does not contain digital signature information.

2\. Improper use of FEL key

When flashing, do not power up the board first, press the FEL key and then power up the board, and then release the FEL key.

3\. The device name has appeared, but the board still cannot be recognized.

![Image](./images/OK527N-C_Linux5.15.47_User_Manual/3e0d49691a2b4c8ba31b7d31f69dd091.png)

Due to numerous unknown devices in Device Manager, choosing the wrong one might install the driver incorrectly. Right-click the device, uninstall it and the device driver.

![Image](./images/OK527N-C_Linux5.15.47_User_Manual/2c3fbd23dae14b61bfc4199fab45dab0.png)

Then unplug other USB devices, set the development board to flashing mode, connect to the host, and reinstall the driver.
