### 3.5 OK3506x -C Carrier Board Description

**Note: The component UID with "\_DNP" mark in the diagram below represents it is not soldered by default. The schematic diagrams in this manual are only for interface description. When you conduct hardware design, please refer to the source file materials.**

#### 3.5.1 Carrier Board Power

Carrier board power supply is DC 12V, led in through DC-005 socket (P1). This 12V DC power supply passes through a switch (S1), TVS protection, a self - recovery fuse, and an anti - reverse connection diode, and then is converted to 5V DC through a DC - DC converter, with a maximum continuous current of 6A. These two power supplies are uncontrolled, and their network names are VCC\_12V and VDD\_5V respectively.

VDD\_5V is converted to VCC5V0\_SYS after passing through two parallel 0 - ohm resistors, R8 and R13. VCC5V0\_SYS is the 5V power supply for the SoM. After the SoM is powered on, it outputs a 3.3V DC voltage as the carrier board power enable signal, with the network named VCC\_3V3\_EN.

![Image](./images/OK3506J-C_User_Hardware_Manual/1753940844180_9567cfb3_65a0_4302_a06d_3c56ce79f19a.png)

When VCC\_3V3\_EN is at a high level, Q1 conducts. After Q1 conducts, U2 conducts, connecting VDD\_5V to the VCC\_5V network, and the entire carrier board is powered on.

![Image](./images/OK3506J-C_User_Hardware_Manual/1753940844265_c3b009ac_add1_4253_b1df_c580fb58ef1c.png)

![Image](./images/OK3506J-C_User_Hardware_Manual/1753940844336_44f39fd8_29ca_4ad5_9891_26af97bb2a6c.png)

This circuit is to ensure that the SoM is powered on first, and followed by the carrier board, so as to prevent the damage to the CPU caused by latch-up effects.

The DC 3.3V power supply of the carrier board consists of two independent DC-DC and one LDO. The DC 3.3V power supply for the 4G module is obtained by converting DC 5V through a DC-DC converter. Its network name is VCC\_3V3\_4G. The DC 3.3V for the audio of the carrier board is converted from 5V via an LDO, with independent power supply. The clean DC power network is VCC \_ 3V3 \_ CODEC. The remaining DC 3.3V power supply of the carrier board is obtained by converting DC 5V through another set of DC-DC converters, and its network name is VCC\_3V3.

At this time, the system enters the BOOTLOADER mode. After starting the system, you can customize it as the volume up button. KEY2 is the V- button, which you can configure as the volume down button. KEY3 is the MENU button, which you can configure as the menu button. KEY4 is the ESC button, which you can configure as the back button. All these four buttons are on the right side of the development board, and the buttons face the right side.

![Image](./images/OK3506J-C_User_Hardware_Manual/1753940844834_6b050cb5_df04_4704_a255_99f3b96f9cfe.png)

#### 3.5.3 BOOT Configuration

SARADC\_IN0\_BOOT serves not only as a button but also as a pin for system boot option selection. When using the SoM configured with SPI\_NAND, turn on switch S3. The boot option order is as follows: boot from the eMMC/TF card first, and then from USB. Turn off S3, and the boot option order becomes: boot from SPI\_NAND first, then from the eMMC/TF card, and finally from USB.

Since the eMMC and TF card share the same set of data buses, only one of them can be used at a time. When using the eMMC version of the SoM, the TF card cannot be used as a system boot medium, nor can it be used as a storage device.

![Image](./images/OK3506J-C_User_Hardware_Manual/1753940844934_75171d50_1bff_4e4e_afcf_cbdbaaf5a096.png)

#### 3.5.4 Debugging Serial Port

A USB Type - C interface is used on the carrier board as a debugging serial port. Connect it to a computer with a data cable and select the corresponding serial port to start debugging.
